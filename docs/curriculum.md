## Visual Progress (Manual Tracking)
You can track personal completion using a simple checklist:

- [x] Module 1 – Foundations
- [x] Module 2 – Regression & Dimensionality Reduction
- [ ] Module 3 – Classification & Model Evaluation
- [ ] Module 4 – MLOps & Responsible AI

---
## Suggested Learning Order
1. Read all Module 1 to build terminology & tooling base.
2. Work through Module 2 while experimenting in notebooks (diagnostics + PCA).
3. Deep-dive into Module 3 classification & evaluation resources, building models and diagnostics in tandem.
4. Explore Module 4 MLOps & Responsible AI practices, focusing on deployment, monitoring, and governance labs.
