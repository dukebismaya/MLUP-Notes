# Machine Learning Curriculum Roadmap

A structured progression from fundamentals through modeling depth and into production & governance. Use this page as an index to explore or track progress.

## Visual Progress (Manual Tracking)
You can track personal completion using a simple checklist:

- [x] Module 1 – Foundations
- [x] Module 2 – Regression & Dimensionality Reduction
- [ ] Module 3 – Advanced ML
- [ ] Module 4 – Production & Ethics

---
## Suggested Learning Order
1. Read all Module 1 to build terminology & tooling base.
2. Work through Module 2 while experimenting in notebooks (diagnostics + PCA).
3. (Upcoming) TODO: Will be added by Bismaya (Module 3).
4. (Upcoming) TODO: Will be added by Bismaya (Module 4).

## Extending This Page
Planned future enhancements:
- Dynamic progress (store in `localStorage`)
- Per-note status badges (Complete / Draft / Planned)
- Skill map heat visualization
