# Module 3 – Classification & Model Evaluation

This module brings together practical classification workflows, evaluation diagnostics, and a roadmap of advanced paradigms.

## Latest Drops

### K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) Implementation
Hands-on walkthrough covering feature scaling, $k=5$ classification, and evaluation metrics with scikit-learn. [Read the full implementation note →](module3-knn-implementation.md)

### Decision Trees – Steps for Classification
Entropy-driven splits, the Play Tennis walkthrough, multi-dataset scikit-learn pipelines, and embedded video explainers. [Explore the dedicated subsection →](module3-decision-trees.md)

### Support Vector Machines – Classification
Maximum-margin intuition, mathematical formulation, and scikit-learn visualisations for binary classification. [Dive into the SVM overview →](module3-svm-classification.md)

### Support Vector Machines – Binary Classification
Margin maximisation, soft-margin intuition, kernel trick, and an RBF-based Iris demo dedicated to two-class problems. [Explore the binary SVM subsection →](module3-svm-binary.md)

### Model Evaluation Metrics with scikit-learn
Accuracy vs precision, ROC-AUC, regression diagnostics, and imbalanced-learning tips with runnable scikit-learn snippets. [Break down the evaluation playbook →](module3-evaluation-metrics.md)

### Curated Video Library
Hand-picked regression, KNN, and evaluation playlists to reinforce Module 3 concepts. [Browse the watchlist →](module3-video-library.md)

## Planned Topics (Tentative)
- Probabilistic Modeling & Bayesian Methods
- Generative Models
- Feature Selection vs Extraction (follow-up to PCA)
- Regularization Paths & Model Selection
- Ensemble Methods (Bagging, Boosting, Stacking)
- Interpretability & Explainability (SHAP, PDP, ICE)

> Status: Drafting phase. Content will roll out incrementally.
