# Module 3 – Coming Soon

This module will expand into advanced machine learning paradigms.

## Planned Topics (Tentative)
- Probabilistic Modeling & Bayesian Methods
- Generative Models
- Feature Selection vs Extraction (follow-up to PCA)
- Regularization Paths & Model Selection
- Ensemble Methods (Bagging, Boosting, Stacking)
- Interpretability & Explainability (SHAP, PDP, ICE)

> Status: Drafting phase. Content will roll out incrementally.
