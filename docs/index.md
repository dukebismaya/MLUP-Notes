## AI & ML Notes Hub

Written by **Bismaya**.

This site is a concise collection of structured Machine Learning notes. Use the search bar or open any note from the navigation to start reading. Each note can be marked complete at the bottom—your progress is stored locally in your browser.

### How to Use
1. Pick a note from the left navigation (or use search).
2. Read & explore headings (TOC appears on longer notes).
3. Click “Mark as Complete” at the end of a note to track progress.

### Progress
A mini progress widget appears below showing how many notes you’ve completed.
